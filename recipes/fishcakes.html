    <h2>Delicious salmon cakes that can be prepared in the air fryer</h2>

    <p>Using tinned fish plus an air fryer literally couldn’t make things any more convenient. All you had to do is mix everything together, shape them into patties and coat with breadcrumbs, pop them into the air fryer – and violà! I usually make the patties the night before so they are firm and set overnight (in place of the brief freezing time instead). That makes it <em>even</em> more convenient on the day.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Tinned salmon</li>
        <li>Thai red curry paste</li>
        <li>Kaffir lime leaves</li>
        <li>Red chilli flakes</li>
        <li>Fish sauce</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>kewpie mayo</li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Fresh coriander leaves</li>
        <li>Lime zest</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Garlic paste</li>
        <li>Ginger paste</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix together all the ingredients for the Salmon Fish Cakes. Shape into patties, roughly just less than a palm's size.</li>
            <li>Coat each patty with breadcrumbs. Place onto a lined baking tray and freeze for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the Air Fryer to 200°C.</li>
            <li>Brush a layer of cooking oil onto the air fryer basket.</li>
            <li>Place salmon fish cakes into the basket, do not overcrowd, and briefly spray/brush oil on top. Cook for 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Flip the fish cakes, brush with more oil if needed, and cook for another 6 minutes until golden in colour.</li>
