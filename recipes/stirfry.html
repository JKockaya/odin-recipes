    <h2>A quick and easy recipe using typical pantry items</h2>
    
    <p>You can’t really go wrong using the ‘Holy Trinity’ of Chinese cooking, <strong>i.e. ginger, garlic and spring onions</strong>. Once you got your hands on them, you can basically stir-fry it with anything super quick and it is guaranteed to taste delicious. That’s why every Chinese household always keeps these three in the kitchen. This <strong>Ginger Garlic Seafood Stir Fry</strong> recipe features the use of these three ingredients and mixed seafood (frozen packs will do). It is super quick to whip up and you can serve it either with a steaming bowl of Jasmine rice or as a noodle topping – et viola!</p>

    <p>The dish features a savoury touch of flavours and makes a really good base should you like to play around with different stir-fry sauces as well. For this recipe, I’ve kept the flavourings <em>fairly</em> simple. This is because I like to let the seafood flavours shine on their own as well! That’s why fresh seafood would be even better here. But if not, good quality frozen seafood would do well too.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>250g frozen mixed seafood</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cooking oil</li>
        <li>15g ginger</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>4-5 stalks spring onion</li>
        <li>salt, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat cooking oil in a wok over high heat. Add ginger and garlic when oil begins to smoke. Stir-fry for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Next, add in seafood. Stir-fry for 3-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season with soy sauce. Stir-fry for about 2 minutes. Add salt   to taste if it still needs flavouring.</li>
        <li>Toss in sliced spring onions until they just begin to wilt. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
