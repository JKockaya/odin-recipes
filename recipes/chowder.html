    <h2>A one-pot pasta soup recipe that’s creamy, savoury, and perfectly hearty to enjoy.</h2>

    <p>As per usual, I like to add my own little twists to the recipe. For instance, I used <strong>ghee</strong> over butter for extra flavour depth, as well as added <strong>red chillies</strong> for a little spike of flavour. You can totally just use regular salmon over smoked salmon but we love that extra smokiness and flavour. And of course, if you don’t fancy the tortellini or pasta, you can totally just have it as a regular soup! Either way, serve it with some garlic bread and you can have a lovely dinner served on the table in 30 minutes.</p>
